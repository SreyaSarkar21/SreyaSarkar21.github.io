Hello and welcome to my homepage. I am a Ph.D. student in Statistics at the [Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://stat.uiowa.edu/) at the University of Iowa. My doctoral thesis is supervised by [Prof. Sanvesh Srivastava](https://blayes.github.io/). I have also had the privilege of being mentored by [Prof. Kshitij Khare](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/kdkhare/) from University of Florida for my doctoral research. 
My Ph.D. thesis focuses on developing computationally efficient Bayesian methods using mixed-effects models for analyzing high-dimensional longitudinal and repeated-measures data with tensor variables, often arising in biomedical and social sciences. These methods leverage dimension reduction techniques based on random projections, and provide strong theoretical guarantees along with practical utility.

I am fortunate to have collaborated with [Prof. Himel Mallick](http://www.himelmallick.org/) from Weill Cornell Medicine as a research assistant during the summer of 2024. At [Mallick Lab](https://mallicklab.weill.cornell.edu/), my research spans two key areas. First, I have developed comprehensive pipeline for multi-study meta-analysis of microbiome networks, applying it to real-world microbiome data consisting of cancer immunotherapy responses. Secondly, I have devised scalable Bayesian methods for multimodal integration, benchmarking them using real-world multi-omics data.  

Before coming to Iowa, I graduated with Master's in Statistics from [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/math/) in 2021, and Bachelor's in Statistics (Honours) from St. Xavier's College (Autonomous), Kolkata in 2019.
